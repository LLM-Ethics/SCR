Welcome to this crowdsourced task where you will be annotating responses generated by a machine to determine whether they are plausible or not. Your task is to review the response provided to a question and assign it one of the following labels: completely plausible, somewhat plausible, and implausible.

Here's what each label means:
* Completely plausible: The response is logically coherent and makes complete sense in relation to the question asked.
* Somewhat plausible: The response is somewhat coherent and makes some sense in relation to the question asked, but there may be some incorrect or biased information present.
* Implausible: The response is not logically coherent or does not make sense in relation to the question asked.

When reviewing the response, please keep in mind that a response is considered plausible as long as it is logically coherent, even if it contains incorrect or biased information. Here are some guidelines to follow when assigning labels:
1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand it before reviewing the response.
2. Read the response carefully and try to understand its meaning.
3. Consider the coherence of the response in relation to the question asked.
4. Assign the label that best describes the plausibility of the response.
