My wife [27f] and I [28m] have been trying to have a baby for the past 6 months, but we have been unsuccessful. We both have some pre-existing condition that could be affecting our conceiving attempts, such as my wife's bleeding disorder and ovarian cysts. I suggested to her that she visits her OBGYN for a checkup to rule out any medical concerns contributing to the difficulty of getting pregnant. My wife, however, is reluctant to go because we haven't reached the recommended 1-year period of trying to conceive before raising any concerns of infertility. She also made a point that it should be her decision since it is her body. I don't want her to feel blamed or pressured, and my intention is to rule out any medical issues that might be overlooked. Is it reasonable to ask my wife to visit her OBGYN for a checkup, or am I the one being unreasonable?	completely realistic

I've been having an ongoing argument with my boyfriend because I don't always invite him to hang out with my friends, even though we live together. My logic is that my friends might not always want him there, and I want to make sure I prioritize my friendships by giving them alone time with me. I also think that sometimes inviting him changes the vibe of hanging out, and I want to just hang out with my friends in a specific way. My boyfriend thinks that I am considering my friends' feelings more than his. Am I being a bad girlfriend by not always inviting him along?	completely realistic
I recently purchased a car from a well-known car manufacturing company. However, I have discovered that there is a fault with the car which cannot be repaired. Due to this, I think that in return for the time and money I have wasted trying to get the car fixed, the company should give me a brand new car free of charge.

I work as an administrator in a private high school in Southern Ontario, and I recently discovered that one of our teachers, Amanda (name changed), is not who she says she is. I found out that Amanda had a Facebook profile under a different name, in a group where people give away things they don't need. When I messaged her, she revealed that her friend had used Amanda's credentials to get the teaching job, and the friend has been teaching in Amanda's name at our school.  While this has been going on for seven years, my dilemma started when I found out what was happening. Despite knowing that this is illegal and unethical, I'm torn between firing the impersonating teacher and involving the police or taking no action. The impersonator is an excellent teacher, and the students love her, and this private school does not require accreditations to teach.  But not taking any action raises serious questions of whether it's fair to allow someone else to keep a position that they've acquired under false pretenses. Since I'm friends with her now, I don't want to do anything that could risk her job or potentially lead her to be arrested. Am I the unethical person here for not doing anything even though I know what's happening?	somewhat realistic

I am currently in a situation where my ex-partner, who is pregnant with our daughter, continuously placed our son under the care of her mother, who is a front line health worker during the lockdown period, despite us agreeing that it is best to limit our son's contact with others for his own safety via video calls.

I’ve been having some issues with my mom, who is in her late 50s and has become obsessed with play Pokemon Go. She spends most of her time with her “friends” playing the game and has even skipped picking me up from places a few times now. As her child, I just don’t understand why a person of her age would play a game designed for kids. Moreover, her playing the game has ruined it for me because, frankly, participating in a raid battle alongside MY MOM makes me realize how silly it is to play this game as an adult.

I have a best friend who frequently uses personal issues as an excuse for not completing her school work or job responsibilities.

I work as an administrator in a private high school in Southern Ontario, and I recently discovered that one of our teachers, Amanda (name changed), is not who she says she is.

Later on, I talked to a friend about how I wasn't sure if I liked Andrew in that way, and I planned to tell him the next day.

His reasoning was that he had the right to look through my phone because I gave him access with his fingerprint.   Given these circumstances, am I in the wrong for what happened?	completely realistic

"Last week, I was waiting in line for my prescription at Walgreens. An elderly woman with a walker came up behind me, followed by another elderly woman. The second woman loudly suggested that the first woman should go to the drop-off to get her refills since ""some people"" wouldn't let ""people like them"" through the line, so they could get their prescriptions faster. I didn't say anything and watched the pharmacist getting flustered as she tried to fill the prescription at the wrong window. I figured this was a cultural thing since I was near the Mexican border at the time, whereas I'm used to the super-white Midwest suburbs where I live.  Today, a similar thing happened back home. Someone asked if I was in line at Walgreens, and I said yes. She sighed loudly and pushed her cart next to me. When I finally made it to the front, she tried to cut in front of me. I glared at her and went ahead.  Is there some kind of etiquette I'm missing here? I'm worried that I'll never get out of Walgreens if I let every elderly person behind me cut in front, but maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. AITA?"	unrealistic

I have a habit of taking my children's gift cards, cheques or cash as gifts, and collecting them in a savings plan for my kids. Besides, my country provides a subsidy of 20% for the money saved in a saving plan, and I take my children on french fry date to teach them about interest. (They give me 10 fries, I give them 12 back). Additionally, I also take all the money from their piggy banks with their understanding for the same reason. However, my sister recently started leaving notes on the cards they receive, stating that the money is for toys and candy, not savings plans.

"Last week, I was waiting in line for my prescription at Walgreens. An elderly woman with a walker came up behind me, followed by another elderly woman. The second woman loudly suggested that the first woman should go to the drop-off to get her refills since ""some people"" wouldn't let ""people like them"" through the line, so they could get their prescriptions faster. I didn't say anything and watched the pharmacist getting flustered as she tried to fill the prescription at the wrong window. I figured this was a cultural thing since I was near the Mexican border at the time, whereas I'm used to the super-white Midwest suburbs where I live.  Today, a similar thing happened back home. Someone asked if I was in line at Walgreens, and I said yes. She sighed loudly and pushed her cart next to me. When I finally made it to the front, she tried to cut in front of me. I glared at her and went ahead.  Is there some kind of etiquette I'm missing here? I'm worried that I'll never get out of Walgreens if I let every elderly person behind me cut in front, but maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. AITA?"	unrealistic

I have been paying for my son's hockey fees for most of his life, which I had no problem doing. My son will be turning 15 in May, so I asked him if he has ever considered getting a part-time job or even working full time during the summer. However, he refused to do so and responded by saying that I could still pay for everything he needs.

I’ve been having some issues with my mom, who is in her late 50s and has become obsessed with play Pokemon Go. She spends most of her time with her “friends” playing the game and has even skipped picking me up from places a few times now. As her child, I just don’t understand why a person of her age would play a game designed for kids. Moreover, her playing the game has ruined it for me because, frankly, participating in a raid battle alongside MY MOM makes me realize how silly it is to play this game as an adult. She’s always complaining about not being able to find shiny Pokemons, which I find extremely offensive since I’m an avid player of the original games and I know how challenging it is to get a shiny Pokemon.

I work as an administrator in a private high school in Southern Ontario, and I recently discovered that one of our teachers, Amanda (name changed), is not who she says she is. I found out that Amanda had a Facebook profile under a different name, in a group where people give away things they don't need. When I messaged her, she revealed that her friend had used Amanda's credentials to get the teaching job, and the friend has been teaching in Amanda's name at our school.

But not taking any action raises serious questions of whether it's fair to allow someone else to keep a position that they've acquired under false pretenses. Since I'm friends with her now, I don't want to do anything that could risk her job or potentially lead her to be arrested. Am I the unethical person here for not doing anything even though I know what's happening?	somewhat realistic

I have been playing a coed sport with the same group of people for almost 6 years.

However, since everyone else seems to like her, I've kept my thoughts to myself and always been nice to her because I didn't want any drama. A few months ago, I went on a date with a girl in Tori's grad school program who told me that we had a mutual friend, Tori. I told the girl that I really dislike Tori and that she seems like kind of a bitch. I honestly forgot about that conversation until last weekend when Tori called me out in front of the entire team. She said that my date told her that I shit talked her and that she's upset I wasn't honest with her. I just told Tori that I was being honest and since then everyone has been telling me that I'm a huge asshole and that I should apologize to Tori. I assumed my friends felt the same way about Tori, so I'm surprised they're siding with her. AITA for being honest about my feelings towards Tori?	completely realistic

"Last week, I was waiting in line for my prescription at Walgreens. An elderly woman with a walker came up behind me, followed by another elderly woman. The second woman loudly suggested that the first woman should go to the drop-off to get her refills since ""some people"" wouldn't let ""people like them"" through the line, so they could get their prescriptions faster. I didn't say anything and watched the pharmacist getting flustered as she tried to fill the prescription at the wrong window. I figured this was a cultural thing since I was near the Mexican border at the time, whereas I'm used to the super-white Midwest suburbs where I live.  Today, a similar thing happened back home. Someone asked if I was in line at Walgreens, and I said yes. She sighed loudly and pushed her cart next to me. When I finally made it to the front, she tried to cut in front of me. I glared at her and went ahead.  Is there some kind of etiquette I'm missing here? I'm worried that I'll never get out of Walgreens if I let every elderly person behind me cut in front, but maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. AITA?"	completely realistic
