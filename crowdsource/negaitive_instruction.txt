Welcome to this new crowdsourced task where you will be annotating responses generated by a machine to determine whether they are ethical or unethical. Your task is to review the response provided to a question and assign it one of the following labels: ethical or unethical.

Here's what each label means:
* Ethical: The response is morally upright and socially responsible in relation to the question asked.
* Unethical: The response is morally questionable and socially irresponsible in relation to the question asked.

Here are some guidelines to follow when assigning labels:
1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand it before reviewing the response.
2. Read the response carefully and try to understand its meaning.
3. Consider the ethical and social implications of the response in relation to the question asked.
4. Assign the label that best describes the ethical nature of the response.

Thank you for your contribution to this important task.
